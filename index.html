                    <p>After graduating with BAs in Communication and Linguistics, I worked in marketing. But after working with contracted developers and becoming curious about web development, marketing quickly lost its luster.</p>
                    <p>I’ve always enjoyed puzzles, and not just casual puzzles, but the most challenging puzzles I can find. So when I learned that programming is problem solving, I started learning HTML that very day.</p>
