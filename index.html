      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>After graduating with BAs in Communication and Linguistics, I worked in marketing for a few years. But after working with contracted developers and becoming curious about web development, marketing quickly lost its luster.</p> 
      <p>I’ve always enjoyed puzzles: jigsaw, logic, sudoku, kakuro. So when I learned that programming is problem solving, I was sold.</p>
      <p>In my current role, I serve as the problem solver and website manager for the marketing team. I’ve been able to streamline some tedious processes, fix bugs on the website, and troubleshoot issues on WordPress.</p> 
      <p>I’m currently attending a training on security and WordPress. I’ve also done some consulting with small business owners, helping them improve page rankings, rework content, and build websites.</p>
      <p>Being a self-taught developer (and with most of my learning happening post-pandemic), my journey has been siloed. I’m ready to take on a full-time role where I can learn from other developers while moving a company’s goals forward and helping improve processes and systems.</p>
      <p>I’m also a cat mom, avid classic sci-fi reader, and sometimes musician.</p>

          <a href="https://schkayla.github.io/pomodoro-timer/" target="_blank"><h4>Pomodoro of Sorts</h4></a>
          <p>I thought of this project when I couldn’t find good playlists combined with a timer like pomodoro. The goal is to have music playing while working and paused while on break, so I don’t have to watch the clock but can follow music cues.</p> 
          <p>I’ve learned during this process that the Spotify API has restrictions, so I’m still working out if it’s possible to use here, but for now I found some YouTube playlists that work similarly.</p>

          <p>This is a brochure website for a client, the initial stage of the design layout before adding the content. It’s a new business, so this is their first website, and they need something simple to start gaining in page rankings and grow their online presence.</p>

          <a href="https://schkayla.github.io/my-bookshelf/" target="_blank"><h4>My Bookshelf</h4></a>
          <p>This project I’ve just started, but my goal is to build a digital bookshelf with a form, using a simple database (like Google sheets) to store my library, be able to add and delete books, and interact with the bookshelf by marking books as read/not read and rating them. So far this is the start of the layout, haven't added functionality yet.</p>
