        <div class="about-text">
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">After graduating with BAs in Communication and Linguistics, I worked in marketing for a few years. But after working with contracted developers and becoming curious about web development, marketing quickly lost its luster.</p> 
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">I’ve always enjoyed puzzles: jigsaw, logic, sudoku, kakuro. So when I learned that programming is problem solving, I was sold.</p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">In my current role, I serve as the problem solver and website manager for the marketing team. I’ve been able to streamline tedious processes, fix bugs on the website, and troubleshoot WordPress issues.</p> 
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">Recently, I completed a training on security and WordPress. I’ve also done some consulting with small business owners, helping them improve page rankings, rework content, and build websites.</p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">Being a self-taught developer (and with most of my learning happening during the pandemic), my journey has been siloed. I’m ready to take on a full-time role where I can learn from other developers while moving a company’s goals forward and helping improve processes and systems.</p>
          <p data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-once="true">Also a cat mom, avid classic sci-fi reader, and sometimes musician.</p>

          <p>I thought of this project when I couldn’t find good playlists combined with a timer like pomodoro. The goal is to have music playing while working and paused while on break, so you don’t have to watch the clock but can follow the music cues.</p> 
          <p>I was going to connect this to my Spotify playlists, but learned that the Spotify API has restrictions, so I’m still figuring out if Spotify will work here. For now I found some YouTube playlists that kind of work with this idea.</p>

          <p>This is a brochure website for a client, the initial stage of the design layout before adding the content. It’s a new business, so this is their first website, and they need something simple to start gaining in page rankings and grow their online presence.</p>

          <p>This project I’ve just started, but my goal is to build a digital bookshelf with a form, using a simple database (like Google sheets) to store my library, be able to add and delete books, and interact with the bookshelf by marking books as read/not read and rating them. So far this is just the layout, haven't added functionality yet.</p>
